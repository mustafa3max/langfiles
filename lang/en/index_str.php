Therefore, through our website, we have provided you with json files for most of the words and texts that can be used in websites and applications, and they have been sorted based on type, such as logins, browsers, or integrated development environments.',

These files can be used in any development method for the site or application that uses, for example, laravel users. array php is used. The method of converting json to array php is easy Very just open the file in any text editor and replace every two vertical points with an equal sign and greater than and so on.
